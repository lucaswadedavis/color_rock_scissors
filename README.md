#Color Rock Scissors

is a crafty.js experiment that uses the paper-rock-scissors blueprint (but with colors instead) and adds the twist that the colors are in limited quantity and act as your health and mana.

blast the enemy thing with color by pressing 'R', 'G', or 'B'. charge color (by sucking in color from the plants - and as a consequence, defoliating the forest) by pressing 'C'.

probably not fit for human consumption yet.
